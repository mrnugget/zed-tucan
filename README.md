# zed-tucan

This is a [Zed](https://zed.dev) extension for my toy language Tucan, which is
not publicly available.

It adds the following two Tree-sitter grammars to Zed:

- [tree-sitter-tucan](https://github.com/mrnugget/tree-sitter-tucan)
- [tree-sitter-tucanir](https://github.com/mrnugget/tree-sitter-tucanir)

It also adds highlighting queries for both.

## Examples

Open the files in `examples` to see what this looks like in Zed.
